# Samgraha  
### AI Patient History & Care Continuity Platform

---

## Overview

Samgraha is an AI-powered clinical continuity and healthcare accessibility platform designed to address one of the most persistent challenges in healthcare systems: **fragmented patient medical information and unequal access to care support**.

In real-world clinical settings, doctors and nurses often reconstruct patient history from scattered, incomplete, or illegible records—while patients, especially from low-literacy or economically vulnerable backgrounds, struggle to navigate healthcare systems and welfare support.

Samgraha acts as **responsible digital health infrastructure** for clinical continuity and healthcare access, enabling clinicians to view structured patient history, generate typed prescriptions, and share de-identified clinical knowledge—without replacing medical judgment or violating patient privacy.

---

## Problem Statement

Healthcare delivery today is constrained by:

- Fragmented medical records across visits, hospitals, and labs  
- Time pressure on clinicians reconstructing patient history manually  
- Illegible handwritten prescriptions and documentation errors  
- Lack of awareness of public healthcare welfare schemes among vulnerable populations  
- Limited accessibility for elderly, low-literacy, or first-time digital users  

These issues result in delays in care, increased clinical risk, preventable costs, and widening health inequities.

## Solution Summary

Samgraha provides a **privacy-first, AI-assisted platform** that:

- Transforms fragmented medical documents into **structured, clinician-readable summaries**
- Maintains a **complete longitudinal patient history** with clear source attribution
- Supports **typed prescriptions** and standardized documentation
- Enables **responsible, de-identified knowledge sharing** for medical education
- Improves **accessibility and welfare awareness** through voice-guided interfaces
- Operates strictly as a **clinical support system**, not a decision-making authority

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Patient History & Clinical Continuity
- Multi-document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, images)
- Structured extraction of diagnoses, medications, procedures, tests, and allergies
- Chronological clinical timelines with full historical retention
- Conflict detection across records with source attribution

### 2. Advanced Clinical Intelligence (Core)
- **Clinical Timeline Diff**: Highlights what changed since the last visit while preserving full history
- **Confidence Heatmap**: Visual confidence indicators for extracted medical data
- **Typed Prescriptions**: Clear, printable prescriptions generated by clinicians
- **Medication Reminders**: AI-generated dose reminders (duration & frequency strictly as prescribed by clinicians)

### 3. Accessibility & Equity
- Voice-narrated onboarding for low-literacy users
- Optional patient-facing welfare information view
- Clinician-accessible “Welfare” panel for informational support
- Offline-first design considerations for low-connectivity environments

### 4. Knowledge Sharing (Responsible & Verified)
- Only verified, licensed professionals can publish case-based articles
- Automatic de-identification of all patient information
- Clinician review and approval before publication
- Educational access for students and researchers

### 5. Safety, Privacy & Governance
- Strict separation of identity and clinical data
- Encrypted identity storage with age-only clinical visibility
- Explicit consent tracking
- Full auditability without storing medical content
- Immediate escalation for suspected fake credentials or misuse

## Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Samgraha is explicitly aligned with:

- **SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-being**  
  Improves continuity, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery

- **SDG 1 – No Poverty**  
  Provides informational access to public healthcare support schemes

- **SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities**  
  Enhances accessibility for low-literacy, elderly, and vulnerable populations

---

## Responsible AI & Limitations

Samgraha is designed with strict responsibility boundaries:

- ❌ No medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations  
- ❌ No automated clinical decision-making  
- ❌ No storage of real patient-identifiable data  
- ❌ No welfare eligibility determination or application submission  

The platform **supports clinicians and patients**, but final decisions always remain with qualified healthcare professionals and official institutions.
